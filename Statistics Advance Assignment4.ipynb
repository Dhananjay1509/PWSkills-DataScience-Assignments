    "- **Relationship**: The margin of error is inversely proportional to the square root of the sample size. As the sample size increases, the margin of error decreases, leading to a more precise estimate of the population parameter.\n",
    "- **Reason**: A larger sample size reduces the standard error of the mean ($\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}$), which in turn decreases the margin of error.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Scenario**: Suppose a company wants to estimate the average time customers spend on their website. They conduct a survey to estimate this average.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Initial Sample**: If the company surveys 100 customers and finds a margin of error of ±5 minutes, they can improve the precision of their estimate by increasing the sample size.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Increased Sample Size**: If the company then surveys 400 customers, the margin of error will decrease. For example, if the standard deviation of the time spent is 20 minutes and the z-score for a 95% confidence level is 1.96:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - For a sample size of 100:\n",
    "    \n",
    "      $\n",
    "      E = 1.96 \\times \\frac{20}{\\sqrt{100}} = 1.96 \\times 2 = 3.92 \\text{ minutes}\n",
    "      $\n",
    "\n",
    "    - For a sample size of 400:\n",
    "    \n",
    "      $\n",
    "      E = 1.96 \\times \\frac{20}{\\sqrt{400}} = 1.96 \\times 1 = 1.96 \\text{ minutes}\n",
    "      $\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Result**: Increasing the sample size from 100 to 400 reduces the margin of error from ±3.92 minutes to ±1.96 minutes, providing a more precise estimate of the average time customers spend on the website.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Margin of Error**: The range within which the true population parameter is expected to lie with a given confidence level.\n",
    "- **Effect of Sample Size**: As sample size increases, the margin of error decreases, leading to more precise estimates.\n",
    "- **Example**: Increasing the sample size in a survey from 100 to 400 reduces the margin of error from ±3.92 minutes to ±1.96 minutes, improving the accuracy of the estimate.\n"

    "To calculate the z-score for a data point, use the following formula:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "where:\n",

    "##### Interpretation\n",

    "##### Significance of the Z-Score\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Relative Position:** This indicates that the value is relatively higher compared to the average value of the population.\n",
    "- **Percentile Rank:** In terms of standard normal distribution, a z-score of 1 corresponds to a percentile rank of approximately 84%. This means that the data point is higher than about 84% of the data points in a normal distribution.\n",

    "Understanding z-scores is crucial for interpreting how a specific data point compares to the overall distribution, allowing for better insights in statistical analysis.\n"

    "#### Degrees of Freedom\n",
    "The degrees of freedom for the t-test is:\n",
    "$\n",
    "df = n - 1 = 30 - 1 = 29\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Critical Value\n",
    "For a 90% confidence level (two-tailed test), the critical t-value can be found using a t-distribution table or a calculator. For $df = 29$, the critical t-value is approximately $\\pm 1.699$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Decision Rule\n",
    "- **Reject $H_0$** if $|t| > 1.699$.\n",
    "- **Fail to reject $H_0$** if $|t| \\leq 1.699$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "Our calculated t-value is approximately $-5.49$, which is greater in magnitude than the critical value of $\\pm 1.699$.\n",
    "Therefore, we reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Result\n",
    "There is sufficient evidence to conclude that caffeine has a significant effect on reaction time at the 90% confidence level."
