    "#### Probability Mass Function (PMF) and Probability Density Function (PDF)\n",
    "\n",
    "Probability Mass Function (PMF) and Probability Density Function (PDF) are concepts used in probability theory and statistics to describe the distribution of random variables. The choice between PMF and PDF depends on whether the random variable is discrete or continuous.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 1. Probability Mass Function (PMF)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:** The PMF is used for discrete random variables. It gives the probability that a discrete random variable is exactly equal to some value.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Properties:**\n",
    "- The sum of all probabilities in a PMF is 1.\n",
    "- The PMF can be represented as a function that maps each value of a discrete random variable to a probability between 0 and 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** Suppose we have a fair six-sided die. Let \\( X \\) be a random variable representing the result of a single die roll. The PMF of \\( X \\) can be defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(X = x) = \n",
    "\\begin{cases} \n",
    "      \\frac{1}{6}, & \\text{if } x = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 \\\\\n",
    "      0, & \\text{otherwise}\n",
    "\\end{cases}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that each possible outcome (1 through 6) has an equal probability of 1/6.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2. Probability Density Function (PDF)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:** The PDF is used for continuous random variables. It describes the relative likelihood for the random variable to take on a given value.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Properties:**\n",
    "- The total area under the PDF curve is 1.\n",
    "- Unlike the PMF, the value of the PDF at a specific point is not a probability; instead, it represents the probability density.\n",
    "- The probability of the random variable falling within a particular interval \\([a, b]\\) is given by the area under the PDF curve from \\( a \\) to \\( b \\):\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{cases} \n",
    "      P(a \\leq X \\leq b) = \\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \\, dx\n",
    "\\end{cases}\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** Consider a continuous random variable \\( X \\) that is normally distributed with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 (standard normal distribution). The PDF of \\( X \\) is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{cases} \n",
    "      f(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} e^{-\\frac{x^2}{2}}\n",
    "\\end{cases}\n",
    "\n",
    "This function describes the probability density of X across all real numbers. The probability that X falls within an interval (e.g., between -1 and 1) is found by calculating the area under the curve between those two points.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- **PMF** is for discrete variables and provides the probability of exact outcomes.\n",
    "- **PDF** is for continuous variables and gives the density of probabilities over a range of outcomes."

    "#### Q2: What is Cumulative Density Function (CDF)? Explain with an example. Why CDF is used?\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)** of a random variable X  is a function that gives the probability that X  is less than or equal to a particular value X . It is mathematically defined as:\n",

    "Consider a fair six-sided die. Let the random variable \\( X \\) represent the outcome of a roll. The CDF for this discrete random variable is calculated by summing the probabilities of all outcomes less than or equal to a specific value.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, if \\( x = 3 \\):\n",

    "##### Examples of Situations Where the Normal Distribution Might Be Used:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Height of People**: Human heights in a given population tend to follow a normal distribution. Heights vary around a mean value, with most people being close to the average and fewer people being at the extremes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Test Scores**: Scores on many standardized tests, such as IQ tests or academic exams, often follow a normal distribution. Most scores cluster around the mean, with fewer individuals scoring very high or very low.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Measurement Errors**: In scientific experiments, errors in measurements often follow a normal distribution. These errors tend to cluster around zero, with larger deviations being less common.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Stock Returns**: Daily returns of stock prices are often modeled using a normal distribution, assuming returns are symmetrically distributed around an average value.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Blood Pressure**: Blood pressure readings in a population typically follow a normal distribution, with most readings near the average and fewer readings at the extremes.\n",

    "##### Parameters of the Normal Distribution and Their Relation to the Shape:\n",
    "\n",
    "The normal distribution is characterized by two parameters: the mean ($\\mu$) and the standard deviation ($\\sigma$).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Mean ($\\mu$)**:\n",
    "   - The mean of the normal distribution determines the center of the distribution. It is the value around which the data points are symmetrically distributed.\n",
    "   - In the probability density function (PDF), the mean shifts the peak of the bell curve along the x-axis.\n",

    "   $$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Standard Deviation ($\\sigma$)**:\n",
    "   - The standard deviation measures the spread or dispersion of the data around the mean. A larger standard deviation results in a wider and flatter bell curve, while a smaller standard deviation results in a narrower and taller curve.\n",
    "   - In the PDF, the standard deviation affects the width of the bell curve, indicating how concentrated the data is around the mean.\n",

    "#### Q4: Explain the importance of Normal Distribution. Give a few real-life examples of Normal Distribution.\n",
    "##### Importance of Normal Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "The normal distribution, also known as the Gaussian distribution, is crucial in statistics and probability for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Foundation of Statistical Inference**: Many statistical methods and tests are based on the assumption that data follows a normal distribution. This includes hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and regression analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Central Limit Theorem**: The normal distribution is important because of the Central Limit Theorem (CLT), which states that the distribution of the sum (or average) of a large number of independent and identically distributed random variables approaches a normal distribution, regardless of the original distribution. This theorem justifies the use of normal distribution in various practical applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Simplicity and Mathematical Properties**: The normal distribution has well-defined mathematical properties that simplify analysis and modeling. Its symmetry and the fact that it is fully described by just two parameters (mean and standard deviation) make it easier to work with compared to other distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Natural Phenomena**: Many natural phenomena and measurement errors follow a normal distribution, making it a useful model for analyzing and predicting real-world data.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Real-Life Examples of Normal Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Height of People**: Human heights in a given population tend to follow a normal distribution. Most individuals have heights around the average, with fewer people being extremely tall or short.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Test Scores**: Scores on standardized tests, such as IQ tests or academic exams, often approximate a normal distribution. Most students score near the average, with fewer students scoring very high or very low.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Measurement Errors**: In scientific experiments and engineering, errors in measurements often follow a normal distribution. Measurement errors are typically small and cluster around zero, with larger errors being less common.\n",
