    "Q1. Which function is used to open a file? What are the different modes of opening a file? Explain each mode of file opening.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function used to open a file in Python is the open() function. This function takes two parameters: the filename and the mode in which the file should be opened. The modes for opening a file are:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"r\" (Read Mode):\n",
    "Opens the file for reading. If the file does not exist, an error occurs.\n",
    "Example: f = open(\"demofile.txt\", \"r\")\n",

    "\"a\" (Append Mode):\n",
    "Opens the file for appending. If the file does not exist, it is created.\n",
    "Example: f = open(\"demofile.txt\", \"a\")\n",
    "\n",
    "\"w\" (Write Mode):\n",
    "Opens the file for writing. If the file exists, its contents are overwritten. If the file does not exist, a new file is created.\n",
    "Example: f = open(\"demofile.txt\", \"w\")\n",
    "\n",
    "\"x\" (Create Mode):\n",
    "Creates the specified file. If the file already exists, an error occurs.\n",
    "Example: f = open(\"demofile.txt\", \"x\")\n",
    "\n",
    "\"t\" (Text Mode):\n",
    "Default mode. Text mode is used for text files.\n",
    "Example: f = open(\"demofile.txt\", \"rt\")\n",
    "\n",
    "\"b\" (Binary Mode):\n",
    "Used for binary files, such as images.\n",
    "Example: f = open(\"demofile.bin\", \"rb\")\n",
    "\n",
    "\"r+\" (Read and Write Mode):\n",
    "Opens the file for both reading and writing. If the file does not exist, an error occurs.\n",
    "Example: f = open(\"demofile.txt\", \"r+\")\n",
    "\n",
    "\"w+\" (Write and Read Mode):\n",

    "Q2. Why close() function is used? Why is it important to close a file?\n",
    "\n",
    "The close() function in Python is used to close an open file. Closing a file is important for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "Resource Management:\n",
    "Limited File Handles: Operating systems have a limited number of file handles available. If you open too many files without closing them, you can run out of available handles, leading to errors or even crashes. Closing files ensures that system resources are released, allowing other programs to use them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Integrity:\n",
    "Buffering: Files are often buffered, meaning that changes made to a file are not immediately written to the disk. Closing a file ensures that any pending data is written to the file, ensuring data integrity and preventing data loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "Performance:\n",
    "Memory Usage: Open files consume memory space. Closing files frees up this memory, which can improve the performance of your program by reducing memory usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Security:\n",
    "File Locking: On Windows, open files are locked, preventing other programs from accessing them. Closing files ensures that these locks are released, allowing other programs to access the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Best Practices:\n",
    "Code Readability and Maintainability: Closing files explicitly is considered good programming practice. It makes your code more readable and maintainable by explicitly managing file resources.\n"
