    "#### Q1. Pearson correlation coefficient is a measure of the linear relationship between two variables. Suppose you have collected data on the amount of time students spend studying for an exam and their final exam scores. Calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between these two variables and interpret the result.\n",
    "##### Pearson Correlation Coefficien\n",
    "\n",
    "The Pearson correlation coefficient ($ r $) measures the linear relationship between two variables. The formula for Pearson correlation is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ r = \\frac{\\sum (x_i - \\bar{x})(y_i - \\bar{y})}{\\sqrt{\\sum (x_i - \\bar{x})^2 \\sum (y_i - \\bar{y})^2}} $\n",

    "where $ x_i $ and $ y_i $ are individual data points, and $ \\bar{x} $ and $ \\bar{y} $ are the means of the $ x $ and $ y $ variables, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- $ r $ ranges from -1 to 1.\n",
    "- $ r = 1 $ indicates a perfect positive linear relationship.\n",

    "- $ r = 0 $ indicates no linear relationship.\n",

Suppose you have collected data on the amount of sleep individuals get each night and their overall job satisfaction level on a scale of 1 to 10.

    "##### Spearman's Rank Correlation\n",
    "\n",
    "Spearman's rank correlation ($ \\rho $) measures the monotonic relationship between two variables. To calculate Spearman's rank correlation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Rank each variable separately.\n",

    "3. Use the formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\rho = 1 - \\frac{6 \\sum d_i^2}{n(n^2 - 1)} $\n",

You collected data on both variables for 50 participants. Calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient and the Spearman's rank correlation between these two variables and compare the results.\n",

    "#### Q4. A researcher is interested in examining the relationship between the number of hours individuals spend watching television per day and their level of physical activity. The researcher collected data on both variables from a sample of 50 participants. Calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between these two variables.\n",
    "##### Pearson Correlation for TV Hours and Physical Activity\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the Pearson correlation formula to assess the linear relationship between hours spent watching television and level of physical activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Positive $ r $ would suggest that more TV watching is associated with more physical activity, which might be counterintuitive.\n",
    "- Negative $ r $ would suggest that more TV watching is associated with less physical activity, which is often expected.\n"

    "\n",
    "##### 2. Summarize the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "We can summarize the data by counting the number of preferences for each soft drink and calculating the average age for each preference.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- Ages: 25, 19, 28\n",
    "- Average Age = (25 + 19 + 28) / 3 = 24\n",

    "**Pepsi:**\n",

    "- Ages: 42, 31\n",
    "- Average Age = (42 + 31) / 2 = 36.5\n",

    "**Mountain Dew:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Age: 37\n",
    "- Average Age = 37\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 3. Analyze the Results\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Coke**: Tends to be preferred by younger individuals (average age: 24).\n",
    "- **Pepsi**: Tends to be preferred by older individuals (average age: 36.5).\n",
    "- **Mountain Dew**: Has a similar age preference to Pepsi, though with only one data point.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 4. Further Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "To make a more rigorous analysis, you could:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Create a Scatter Plot**: Plot age against soft drink preference to visually inspect any trends.\n",
    "- **Conduct Statistical Tests**: Perform statistical tests (e.g., ANOVA) to determine if the differences in ages for different soft drink preferences are statistically significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "From the data provided, there appears to be a trend where younger individuals prefer Coke, while older individuals prefer Pepsi. Mountain Dew is a bit of an outlier with only one data point. Further analysis could help confirm or refute these observations."
