    "Q1. What is an API? Give an example, where an API is used in real life.\n",
    "\n",
    "An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. It serves as an intermediary that enables the exchange of data and functionality between systems. For example, when you use a ride-sharing app like Uber, it communicates with various APIs to access maps, payment processing, and user data, allowing you to book a ride seamlessly.\n"

    "Q2. Give advantages and disadvantages of using API.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages\n",
    "Efficiency: APIs allow developers to integrate complex functionalities quickly without needing to build them from scratch.\n",
    "Scalability: APIs can be designed to handle increased loads and can be modified without affecting the entire system.\n",
    "Customization: Developers can tailor API functionalities to meet specific needs, enhancing user experience.\n",
    "Security: APIs can provide controlled access to data and functionalities, allowing for secure interactions between systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages\n",
    "Dependency: Relying on third-party APIs can lead to issues if the API provider changes or discontinues the service.\n",
    "Complexity: Managing multiple APIs can become complex, especially if they have different protocols and data formats.\n",
    "Performance: API calls can introduce latency, particularly if they involve multiple network requests.\n"

    "\n",
    "What is a Web API?\n",
    "A Web API is a specific type of API that operates over the web, allowing applications to communicate using HTTP protocols. While all web services are APIs, not all APIs are web services. Web APIs are designed for interaction over the internet, enabling functionalities like retrieving data from a server or sending data to a client.\n",
    "\n",
    "Differences Between API and Web API\n",
    "Scope: APIs can exist in various forms (local, web-based, etc.), while Web APIs specifically refer to APIs that use web protocols.\n",
    "Communication: Web APIs typically use HTTP/HTTPS for communication, while APIs can operate over other protocols as well.\n"

    "Q4. Explain REST and SOAP Architecture. Mention shortcomings of SOAP.\n",
    "\n",
    "***REST (Representational State Transfer)***\n",
    "REST is an architectural style that uses standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for communication. It is stateless, meaning each request from a client contains all the information needed to process it. REST APIs are flexible, allowing various data formats (JSON, XML, etc.) and are designed to be simple and scalable.\n",
    "\n",
    "***SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)***\n",
    "SOAP is a protocol for exchanging structured information in web services. It relies on XML for message format and supports various transport protocols, such as HTTP and SMTP. SOAP is more rigid than REST, requiring strict standards for communication and often involving more overhead due to its complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Shortcomings of SOAP***\n",
    "Complexity: SOAP's strict standards and XML messaging can make it cumbersome to implement and maintain.\n",
    "Performance: SOAP messages tend to be larger and more complex, which can lead to slower performance compared to REST.\n",
    "Scalability: Because SOAP maintains state between requests, it can be more challenging to scale than REST, which is stateless.\n"
